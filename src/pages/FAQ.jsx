            question: "What is blockchain-based donation?",
            answer: "Blockchain-based donation is a transparent way of giving to charities using cryptocurrency. Each transaction is recorded on a public ledger, allowing donors to track exactly how their funds are utilized by NGOs."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I create a wallet to donate?",
            answer: "You can create a cryptocurrency wallet using platforms like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet. After installation, follow the instructions to create your wallet and purchase or transfer cryptocurrency to make donations."
        },
        {
            question: "Which cryptocurrencies do you accept?",
            answer: "Currently, we accept Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and several stable coins like USDC and DAI. We're constantly working to expand the range of accepted cryptocurrencies."
        },
        {
            question: "How can I verify my donation was received?",
            answer: "All donations are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified using blockchain explorers. After donating, you'll receive a transaction hash that you can use to track and verify your donation."
        },
        {
            question: "Are donations tax-deductible?",
            answer: "Tax deductibility depends on your local regulations and the NGO's status. Most NGOs on our platform provide donation receipts that can be used for tax purposes. Please consult with a tax professional for specific advice."
        },
        {
            question: "How are NGOs vetted on your platform?",
            answer: "We have a thorough vetting process that includes verification of legal status, financial transparency reviews, and impact assessment. We only partner with organizations that meet our strict criteria for accountability and transparency."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I donate anonymously?",
            answer: "Yes, blockchain technology allows for pseudo-anonymous donations. While transactions are recorded on the public ledger, your personal identity isn't necessarily linked to your wallet address."
